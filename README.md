This repository contains the code to fit a regression model using the Hierarchical Grouped Horseshoe Prior (HGHP). 

The Stan code for the HGHP is found in the folder "Stan/HGHP". Since our application
used a binary outcome, we use the hghp_logistic.stan file, but the prior is also
implemented for normal and time-to-event responses. The R file containing the 
functions that obtain the necessary Stan data and fit the Stan model are found in 
the "R-Wrappers" folder.

Comparison methods include the standard Horseshoe, Horseshoe+, Regularized Horseshoe,
Bayesian LASSO, and noninformative prior. The standard Horseshoe and Horseshoe+ priors
are implemented in existing R packages, while the Stan and R code for the Regularized
Horseshoe, Bayesian LASSO, and noninformative prior are found in the "Stan/Comparison"
and "R-Wrappers" folders.

An example workflow is contained in the folder "Data". The file "setup.R" creates
a dataset with categorical covariates and a binary response generated using a 
logistic regression model with sparse coefficient settings. An example dataset
is already included as "sample_df.Rds". The model is fit in the file 
"Data/Analysis/hghp_analysis.R". Code for fitting the comparison methods is also 
included in the "Data/Analysis" folder. "Data/Analysis/comparison.R" runs
the HGHP and comparison analysis files and creates a forestplot for visualizing
the different parameter estimates. The results of these fits are contained in
the "Data/Analysis/Results" folder.
